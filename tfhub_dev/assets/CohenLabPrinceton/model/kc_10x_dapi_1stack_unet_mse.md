## Overview
This U-Net model has been pre-trained using the KC (10x) Nuclei dataset, imaged with a DAPI filter. The complete dataset can be found at: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3783678
All details regarding the model and data collection can be found in our paper, "Practical Fluorescence Reconstruction for Large Samples and Low-Magnification Imaging", J. LaChance and D. Cohen.
